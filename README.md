**MiSTer add-on board for DE0-Nano-SoC FPGA dev board.**

__Caution__: this is **WORK IN PROGRESS** , it has not been tested and no support is provided. 
No software exists for this board yet!

__What is it for__: an add-on board for Terasic DE0-Nano-SOC FPGA development board which may
eventually be compatible with the [MiSTer project](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki).

__Who is it for__: only for the brave tinkerers :).

__What can I find here__: you can find a design file for the add-on board, which can be opened and
edited in free gEDA-pcb editor (http://pcb.geda-project.org/). No gerber files are provided until
the board is tested - this is purely to prevent disappointment for eager enthusiasts in case the board
has design flaws. However you are free (and welcome) to open the design file and press the 'Export' option in the
File menu to generate your own gerbers.
